# Unhandled API Fetch Errors in React Component

This repository demonstrates a common React coding error: the failure to properly handle errors during API data fetching.  The `BuggyComponent.jsx` file shows the flawed implementation, resulting in a silent failure if the API request fails.  The `FixedComponent.jsx` file demonstrates the correct way to handle errors using try-catch blocks and error states, providing a more robust user experience.

## How to reproduce the bug:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npm start`.
4. Observe the behavior of both components in the browser.  The BuggyComponent will likely fail silently, while FixedComponent will handle errors gracefully.

## Solution:
The solution involves carefully using async/await and try...catch blocks to handle potential errors from the API request.  The component will now update its state to reflect the error, allowing for better user feedback and error handling strategies.
